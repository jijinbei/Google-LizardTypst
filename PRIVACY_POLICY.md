# Privacy Policy for LizardTypst

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-23

This Privacy Policy describes how LizardTypst ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our Google Slides add-on (the "Service").

## 1. No Collection of Personal Information

We believe in privacy by design. The LizardTypst add-on is built to be a fully client-side tool. This means:

- **We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal data.**
- **We do not collect any content from your Google Slides or any Typst code you enter.**

All processing of your Typst code happens entirely within your own web browser on your local machine. Nothing is ever sent to our servers or any third-party servers.

## 2. Information Processed by the Add-on

- **Typst Code and Rendered Images:** The code you write is processed in your browser to generate an image. This data is used only for the core functionality of the add-on and is inserted directly into your slide. It is not stored by the add-on.
- **Equation History:** The add-on saves your 20 most recent entries in your browser's local storage for your convenience. This data is stored only on your computer and is not accessible to us.

## 3. Google's Privacy Policy

Because LizardTypst operates within Google Slides, your use of Google Slides itself is governed by Google's own Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the data practices of Google.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us by opening an issue on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/jijinbei/Google-LizardTypst/).
